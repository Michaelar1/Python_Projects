### Royal Hotels Project
  This project used Django to create the back-end functionality for a room service menu database that has the ability to create, edit, and delete menu items.

### Web Page Generator Assignment
  This was a simple assignment using Tkinter to create a GUI that will allow the user to generate a web page with or without custom text input.

### Phonebook Assignment
  In this assignment, I created a phonebook app that can add, edit, and delete information from a GUI phonebook. Included in this program is use of SQLite3 to allow the app to interact with a database that stores the information and Tkinter, which provides the GUI.

### Polymorphism assignment
  In this assignment, I created a parent class with two child classes with one attribute from each child class being polymorphic for an attribute of the parent class in a given method.

### Inheritance Assignment
  This was an assignment to create a parent class and two child classes that inherit from the parent class.

### Database Assignment
  In this assignment, I create a database and table using Python in conjunction with SQL Lite 3 and iterate through a tuple of file names to only insert the file names with the extension ".txt" into the table. It then prints the names of the .txt files in the IDLE Shell.

### Script Assignment
  In this assignment I created a script that iterates through a directory, selects the files with the ".txt" extension, and displays them with their last modified date and time. I used the os and time libraries and the os and os.path modules, for loops, and dunder methods.

### Nice or Mean Game
  In this assignment it is demonstrated how to pass variables from function to function by producing a functional game.

### Program Scope Assignment
  In this assignment, I demonstrated variable scope and how it affects the output of the code. I included both a global and a local variable to show that code with a local variable with the same name as a global variable would display with the local variable over the global one.

### Function Assignment
  This was an assignment to create a function and store it as a variable.

### Lambda Assignment
  This was a simple assignment to create and use a lambda function.

### Loop an Array Assignment
  In this assignment, I used enumerate to be able to loop through an array of letters in a string.

### For Loops Assignment
  In this assingment, I used for loops to iterate through lists and integers. I used break, continue, range(), and else.

### While Looops Assignment
  In this assignment I used while loops with break, continue, and else.

### Boolean Assignment
  In this assignment, I used if, elif, else, bool(), and ifinstance().

### Python If
  This was a short assignment to use if, elif, and else along with nested if statements.
