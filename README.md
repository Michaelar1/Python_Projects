### Loop an Array Assignment
  In this assignment, I used enumerate to be able to loop through an array of letters in a string.

### For Loops Assignment
  In this assingment, I used for loops to iterate through lists and integers. I used break, continue, range(), and else.

### While Looops Assignment
  In this assignment I used while loops with break, continue, and else.

### Boolean Assignment
  In this assignment, I used if, elif, else, bool(), and ifinstance().

### Python If
  This was a short assignment to use if, elif, and else along with nested if statements.
